# SmokerVsDiseaseModel

## Project Overview
"Bangladesh-Smokers-Survey" is a data-driven initiative to analyze the effects of smoking on health among people in Bangladesh. This project includes a comprehensive survey, covering both smokers and non-smokers, to gather insights on their smoking habits, health issues, and awareness about smoking risks.

### Data Collection
We collected data on the following attributes:
- Age
- Gender
- Profession
- District
- Smoking Status
- Age at Initiation
- Exposure to Secondhand Smoke
- Awareness of Smoking Risks
- Pocket Money
- Cough
- Shortness of Breath
- Chest Pain
- Fatigue
- Persistent Cough
- Wheezing

## Methodology
The project employs various machine learning methods for predictive analysis, including:
- RandomForestClassifier
- KMeans
- GaussianNB
- LogisticRegression
- DecisionTreeClassifier
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

These methods help in identifying patterns and making predictions about health issues related to smoking.

## Data Analytics and EDA
We conducted extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's characteristics and uncover underlying patterns. This step was crucial in preparing the data for model building and hypothesis testing.

## ML Model Building
Adhering to standard ML practices, we built and evaluated several models to predict health outcomes based on smoking habits and other collected data.

## Visualization and Results
Our findings are presented through various visualizations, offering intuitive insights into the health impacts of smoking.
